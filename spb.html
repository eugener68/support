  <h2>About Playlist Maker</h2>
  <p>
    Playlist Maker is an iOS app that creates playlists from a user-provided list of artists. These playlists could be imported to user's personal Spotify account
    You can type artist names manually, paste a list from the clipboard, or import artists from CSV or TXT files.
    The app helps you control variety and structure, so your playlist feels balanced instead of repetitive.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Create playlists from an artist list (manual entry, paste, or CSV/TXT import)</li>
    <li>Set the total number of tracks</li>
    <li>Limit tracks per artist to keep a good mix</li>
    <li>Shuffle the playlist for variety</li>
    <li>Prefer original versions when available</li>
    <li>Auto-generate playlist names with an optional current date</li>
    <li>Dry Run mode: preview the track list without creating a playlist on Spotify</li>
    <li>Localization: the app follows your iPhone language (Russian supported)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    First, sign in to your Spotify account. Then choose your playlist settings, enter a playlist name (optionally with
    today’s date), and run a Dry Run to review the generated track list. If everything looks right, create the playlist
    in Spotify and start listening.
  </p>

  <h2>Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Your Spotify account data is not stored or shared by the app. Authentication is used only to create playlists in your
